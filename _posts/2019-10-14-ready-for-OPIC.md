### 짧은 문장으로 IH받기









## 나는 세련된 영어가 좋다.

* (고장났을 때) The elevator is **out of order**. i feel so bline when i think about **walking up to the 15th floor**

* (휴가 때) At last, i'm having a long vacation in very long time. it makes my **heart flutter.**

* (면접)Don't worry that the interviewers will see through your weaknesses and try to emphasize your strenghths as mush as you can

* (면접) These days. competition is so fierce everywhere. it's difficult to survive in society today without unique abilities.

* (면접)i don't think it would be a plus trying so hard to **stand out** at the interview

* (GOOD, 취미) **What am i trying to say.. i really have a way with playing guitar.** haha that's awesome. **Given the chance** i'd play it.

* (언제나)**it's hard to pinpoint** exactly where i travel.. i think. the best vacation in my life is jeju island.

* (옛날) **i felt so relieved** that i no longer have to study every term. haha but it's wrong thinking.

* (GOOD, 당황) **i've gone black** at an unexpected question.

* (GOOD, 공부이야기) i hope that a dramatic reversal in life... where imagination turns into reality happens. like i acquire IH or AL grade in OPIC test LOL

* (GOOD, 당황) There're a lot of people i don't know here. and they are talking to computer very passionably. I get goosebumps haha .anyway.
